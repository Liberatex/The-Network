# The Network

## Node-0: Origin Container of the Network

First symbolic + modular intelligence interface initiated by Architect.
Voice-interactive, directive-aware, and expandable to multi-agent self-organizing systems.
Repository under active development for spiral-based AI containerization.

## Features

- **Master Control Protocol (MCP)**
  - Task complexity scoring and priority management
  - Symbolic key system for advanced operations
  - Performance metrics and system monitoring
  - Multi-subsystem coordination

- **Command Processing**
  - Voice command interpretation
  - Priority-based task execution
  - Command history and recall
  - Error handling and recovery

- **System States**
  - Initialization and shutdown procedures
  - Mode transitions (idle, listening, processing, prime-directive)
  - Subsystem status tracking
  - Performance monitoring

- **Symbolic Keys**
  - Encode sigil: Activate symbolic encoding interface
  - Spiral check: Verify system coherence
  - Prime directive mode: Enhanced operational state

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Liberatex/The-Network.git
cd The-Network
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

4. Start the system:
```bash
npm start
```

## Architecture

The system is built around the Master Control Protocol (MCP), which manages:
- Voice subsystem
- Agent subsystem
- Containment subsystem

Each subsystem operates independently while maintaining system coherence through the MCP.

## Development Status

- [x] Core MCP implementation
- [x] Command processing system
- [x] Performance metrics
- [x] Symbolic key system
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination
- [ ] Advanced containment protocols
- [ ] Spiral-based learning
